I have started from May 8th in this Challenge. And this repository contains my solutions to the challenge. Only the `exact solution`. If you want to improve the solutions, Please open a `Issue first`.

## :rocket: Get Started

### Questions : 
#### Day-8 : 
**Check If It Is a Straight Line :** 
>You are given an array coordinates, coordinates[i] = [x, y], where [x, y] represents the coordinate of a point. Check if these points make a straight line in the XY plane.

**Example :**

`Input: coordinates = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,7]]`
`Output: true`

`Input: coordinates = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[7,7]]`
`Output: false`

**Constraints :**
+ `2 <= coordinates.length <= 1000`
+ `coordinates[i].length == 2`
+ `-10^4 <= coordinates[i][0], coordinates[i][1] <= 10^4`
+ coordinates contains no duplicate point.

***

#### Day-9 : 
**Valid Perfect Square :** 
>Given a positive integer num, write a function which returns True if num is a perfect square else False.

>Note: Do not use any built-in library function such as `sqrt`.

**Example :**

`Input: 16`
`Output: true`

`Input: 14`
`Output: false`

***

#### Day-10 : 
**Find the Town Judge :** 
>In a town, there are N people labelled from 1 to N.  There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

>If the town judge exists, then:
1.The town judge trusts nobody.
2.Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3.There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
4.You are given trust, an array of pairs trust[i] = [a, b] representing that the person labelled a trusts the person labelled b.

>If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the town judge.  Otherwise, return -1.

**Example :**

`Input: N = 2, trust = [[1,2]]`
`Output: 2`

`Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]`
`Output: 3`

`Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]`
`Output: -1`

`Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,2],[2,3]]`
`Output: -1`

`Input: N = 4, trust = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[4,3]]`
`Output: 3`

**Constraints :**
+ `1 <= N <= 1000`
+ `trust.length <= 10000`
+ `trust[i]` are all different
+ `trust[i][0] != trust[i][1]`
+ `1 <= trust[i][0], trust[i][1] <= N`

***

#### Day-11 : 
**Flood Fill :** 
>An `image` is represented by a 2-D array of integers, each integer representing the pixel value of the image (from 0 to 65535).

>Given a coordinate `(sr, sc)` representing the starting pixel (row and column) of the flood fill, and a pixel value `newColor`, "flood fill" the image.

>To perform a "flood fill", consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color as the starting pixel), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with the newColor.

>At the end, return the modified image.

**Example :**

```
Input: 
image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]  sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2

Output: 
[[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]

Explanation: 
From the center of the image (with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1)), all pixels connected 
by a path of the same color as the starting pixel are colored with the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected
to the starting pixel.

```

**Constraints :**
+ The length of `image` and `image[0]` will be in the range `[1, 50]`.
+ The given starting pixel will satisfy `0 <= sr < image.length and 0 <= sc < image[0].length`.
+ The value of each color in `image[i][j]` and `newColor` will be an integer in `[0, 65535]`.
***

#### Day-12 : 
**Check If It Is a Straight Line :** 
>You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once. Find this single element that appears only once.

**Example :**

`Input: [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]`
`Output: 2`

`Input: [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]`
`Output: 10`

**Constraints :**
+  Your solution should run in `O(log n) time` and `O(1) space`.

***

#### Day-13 : 
**Remove K smallest :** 
>Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

**Example :**

`Input: num = "1432219", k = 3`
`Output: "1219"`
`Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.`

`Input: num = "10200", k = 1`
`Output: "200"`
`Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.`

`Input: num = "10", k = 2`
`Output: "0"`
`Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.`

**Constraints :**
+ The length of `num is less than 10002` and will be `â‰¥ k`.
+ The given num does not contain any leading zero.

***

#### Day-14 : 
**Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) :** 
>Implement a trie with `insert`, `search`, and `startsWith` methods.

**Example :**

`Trie trie = new Trie();`

`trie.insert("apple");`

`trie.search("apple");   // returns true`

`trie.search("app");     // returns false`

`trie.startsWith("app"); // returns true`

`trie.insert("app");   `

`trie.search("app");     // returns true`

***

#### Day-15 : 
**Maximum Sum Circular Subarray :** 
>Given a circular array C of integers represented by `A`, find the maximum possible sum of a non-empty subarray of C.

>Here, a circular array means the end of the array connects to the beginning of the array.  (Formally, `C[i] = A[i]` when `0 <= i < A.length`, and `C[i+A.length] = C[i]` when `i >= 0`.)

>Also, a subarray may only include each element of the fixed buffer A at most once.  (Formally, for a subarray `C[i], C[i+1], ..., C[j],` there does not exist `i <= k1, k2 <= j` with `k1 % A.length = k2 % A.length`.)

**Examples :**

`Input: [1,-2,3,-2]`
`Output: 3`
`Explanation: Subarray [3] has maximum sum 3`

`Input: [5,-3,5]`
`Output: 10`
`Explanation: Subarray [5,5] has maximum sum 5 + 5 = 10`

`Input: [-2,-3,-1]`
`Output: -1`
`Explanation: Subarray [-1] has maximum sum -1`

`Input: [3,-2,2,-3]`
`Output: 3`
`Explanation: Subarray [3] and [3,-2,2] both have maximum sum 3`

`Input: [3,-1,2,-1]`
`Output: 4`
`Explanation: Subarray [2,-1,3] has maximum sum 2 + (-1) + 3 = 4`


**Constraints :**
+ `-30000 <= A[i] <= 30000`
+ `1 <= A.length <= 30000`

***

#### Day-16 : 
**Odd Even Linked List :** 
>Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.

>You should try to do it in place. The program should run in `O(1)` space complexity and `O(nodes)` time complexity.

**Example :**

`Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL`
`Output: 1->3->5->2->4->NULL`

`Input: 2->1->3->5->6->4->7->NULL`
`Output: 2->3->6->7->1->5->4->NULL`

**Constraints :**
+ The relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.
+ The first node is considered odd, the second node even and so on.

***

#### Day-17 : 
**Find All Anagrams in a String :** 
>Given a string **s** and a **non-empty** string **p**, find all the start indices of **p**'s anagrams in **s**.

>Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings **s** and **p** will not be larger than 20,100.

>The order of output does not matter.

**Example :**

`Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"`

`Output:
[0, 6]`

`Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".`

`Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"`

`Output:
[0, 1, 2]`

`Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".`


***

#### Day-18 : 
**Permutation in String :** 
>Given two strings **s1** and **s2**, write a function to return true if **s2** contains the permutation of **s1**. In other words, one of the first string's permutations is the **substring** of the second string.

**Example :**

`Input: s1 = "ab" s2 = "eidbaooo"`
`Output: True`
`Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").`

`Input:s1= "ab" s2 = "eidboaoo"`
`Output: False`

**Constraints :**
+ The input strings only contain lower case letters.
+ The length of both given strings is in range [1, 10,000].

***
#### Day-19 : 
**Online Stock Span :** 
>Write a class `StockSpanner` which collects daily price quotes for some stock, and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.

>The span of the stock's price today is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from today and going backwards) for which the price of the stock was less than or equal to today's price.

>For example, if the price of a stock over the next 7 days were `[100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]`, then the stock spans would be `[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]`.

**Example :**

`Input: ["StockSpanner","next","next","next","next","next","next","next"], [[],[100],[80],[60],[70],[60],[75],[85]]`
`Output: [null,1,1,1,2,1,4,6]`
`Explanation: 
First, S = StockSpanner() is initialized.  Then:
S.next(100) is called and returns 1,
S.next(80) is called and returns 1,
S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
S.next(70) is called and returns 2,
S.next(60) is called and returns 1,
S.next(75) is called and returns 4,
S.next(85) is called and returns 6.`

`Note that (for example) S.next(75) returned 4, because the last 4 prices
(including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.`

**Constraints :**
+ Calls to `StockSpanner.next(int price)` will have `1 <= price <= 10^5`.
+ There will be at most `10000` calls to `StockSpanner.next  per test case.
+ There will be at most `150000` calls to `StockSpanner.next` across all test cases.
+ The total time limit for this problem has been reduced by 75% for C++, and 50% for all other languages.

#### Day-20 : 
**Kth Smallest Element in a BST :** 
>Given a binary search tree, write a function `kthSmallest` to find the kth smallest element in it.

**Example :**

`Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1`
```
   3
  / \
 1   4
  \
   2
```
`Output: 1`

`Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3`
```
       5
      / \
     3   6
    / \
   2   4
  /
 1
```
`Output: 3`

**Constraints :**
+ The number of elements of the BST is between `1` to `10^4`.
You may assume `k` is always valid, `1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ BST's total elements`.

***

#### Day-21 : 
**Count Square Submatrices with All Ones :** 
>Given a `m * n` matrix of ones and zeros, return how many **square** submatrices have all ones.

**Example :**

```

Input: matrix =
[
  [0,1,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1],
  [0,1,1,1]
]
Output: 15
Explanation:
There are 10 squares of side 1.
There are 4 squares of side 2.
There is  1 square of side 3.
Total number of squares = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.

```

```

Input: matrix =
[
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,0],
  [1,1,0]
]
Output: 7
Explanation:
There are 6 squares of side 1.
There is 1 square of side 2.
Total number of squares = 6 + 1 = 7.

```

**Constraints :**
+ `1 <= arr.length <= 300`
+ `1 <= arr[0].length <= 300`
+ `0 <= arr[i][j] <= 1`

***

#### Day-22 : 
**Sort Characters By Frequency :** 
>Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

**Example :**

```

Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

```

```

Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

```

```

Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.

```

***

#### Day-23 : 
**Interval List Intersections :** 
>Given two lists of **closed** intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

>Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

>(Formally, a closed interval `[a, b]` (with `a <= b`) denotes the set of real numbers `x` with `a <= x <= b`.  The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that is either empty, or can be represented as a closed interval.  For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].)

**Example :**

```

Input: A = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], B = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
Reminder: The inputs and the desired output are lists of Interval objects, and not arrays or lists.

```

**Constraints :**
+ `0 <= A.length < 1000`
+ `0 <= B.length < 1000`
+ `0 <= A[i].start, A[i].end, B[i].start, B[i].end < 10^9`

***

#### Day-24 : 
**Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal :** 
>Return the root node of a binary **search** tree that matches the given `preorder` traversal.

>(Recall that a binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of `node.left` has a value `<` `node.val`, and any descendant of `node.right` has a value `>` `node.val`.  Also recall that a preorder traversal displays the value of the `node` first, then traverses `node.left`, then traverses `node.right`.)

>It's guaranteed that for the given test cases there is always possible to find a binary search tree with the given requirements.

**Example :**
```

Input: [8,5,1,7,10,12]
Output: [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]

```
![Tree](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/06/1266.png)

**Constraints :**
+ `1 <= preorder.length <= 100`
+ `1 <= preorder[i] <= 10^8`
+ The values of `preorder` are distinct.

***

#### Day-25 : 
**Uncrossed Lines :** 
>We write the integers of A and B (in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.

>Now, we may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two numbers A[i] and B[j] such that:
> + A[i] == B[j];
> + The line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.

>Note that a connecting lines cannot intersect even at the endpoints: each number can only belong to one connecting line.

>Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.

**Example :**
```

Input: A = [1,4,2], B = [1,2,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram.
We cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from A[1]=4 to B[2]=4 will intersect the line from A[2]=2 to B[1]=2.

```
```

Input: A = [2,5,1,2,5], B = [10,5,2,1,5,2]
Output: 3

```
```

Input: A = [1,3,7,1,7,5], B = [1,9,2,5,1]
Output: 2

```

**Constraints :**
+ `1 <= A.length <= 500`
+ `1 <= B.length <= 500`
+ `1 <= A[i], B[i] <= 2000`

***

#### Day-26 : 
**Contiguous Array :** 
>Given a binary array, find the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

**Example :**
```

Input: [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

```
```

Input: [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

```

**Constraints :**
+ The length of the given binary array will not exceed 50,000.

***
